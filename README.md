# Strings-tracker
Asking the user to provide his first name, last name, and his email address and print two strings:<br />
- A heading that greets the user saying: "Hello, (user's first name) (user's last name)" . 
- A substring tracks the user's email and print it simultaneously while the user is typing it.

**Note** that the greeting string will include the comma after the word "Hello" only if the user started typing his first name.
